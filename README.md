## About myself

Hi :wave: !
I am a French passionnate coder on [GitHub](https://github.com/Naereen) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/lbesson)!
I used to define myself as a :snake: Python fan, nowadays I would most likely just say I like Python, OCaml and Bash as my favorite programming languages!

Since September 2019, I am a junior professor in Computer Science and Mathematics at ENS de Rennes in France, and I love teaching!

I pursued a Ph.D in telecommunications, applied mathematics, machine learning and computer science, at the engineering school CentraleSupélec in Rennes and at Inria in Lille since 2016 to 2019, and I graduated in November 2019.

I love byking, hiking, traveling by hitch-hiking, [cooking](https://perso.crans.org/besson/cuisine/) etc.
