## About myself

Hi :wave: !
I am a :fr: French passionnate coder on [GitHub](https://github.com/Naereen) (also [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/lbesson) & [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Naereen)!)
I used to define myself as a :snake: Python fan, nowadays I would most likely just say I like Python, OCaml and Bash as my favorite programming languages! I also love Julia, and would like to learn and use more Rust, GoLang and TypeScript.

Since September 2019, I am a junior professor in Computer Science (and Mathematics) at ENS de Rennes in France, and I love teaching!
I teach various courses: a long course [INF1](https://perso.crans.org/besson/teach/INF1_L1_Rennes1_2020-21/) at L1 (+1) level at University Rennes 1 (introduction to programming in Java), a short one ["Introduction to Computer Science"](https://perso.crans.org/besson/teach/intro_num_DEM_2020/) at L3 (+3) level for law and economics students at ENS Rennes.
Most of my hours are for computer science students at ENS Rennes: classes or practical sessions for [Algorithmics 1/2](https://perso.crans.org/besson/teach/info1_algo1_2019/), I grade projects for a [advanced programming course in C++](https://mquinson.frama.io/prog2-cpp/) at L3 (+3) level ; I also give practical sessions for [Signal Processing](https://perso.crans.org/besson/teach/Traitement_de_Signal_2020/) at M1 (+4) level.
I also [invite researchers to come talk to our students](http://www.dit.ens-rennes.fr/seminaires/) twice a month, reach me out if you're interested!
My main task is to manage the [intense training for national competitive exam "agrégation de mathématiques"](http://www.dit.ens-rennes.fr/agregation-option-d/) for the Computer Science minor, for which I teach various small courses at M2 (+5) level, and give reharsal oral exams (see [notebooks](https://perso.crans.org/besson/notebooks/agreg/)).

Before that, [I pursued a Ph.D](https://perso.crans.org/besson/phd/) ([phd.pdf](https://perso.crans.org/besson/phd.pdf)) in telecommunications, applied mathematics, machine learning and computer science, at the engineering school CentraleSupélec in Rennes and at Inria in Lille since 2016 to 2019, and I graduated in November 2019. I [wrote research articles](https://perso.crans.org/besson/publications) and [research software](https://github.com/SMPyBandits/). I do less research but still a little bit, since my PhD defense.

Outside of computer science and teaching, I love byking, hiking, traveling by hitch-hiking, [cooking](https://perso.crans.org/besson/cuisine/) etc. I live alone and work at home in Rennes, and I'm a strong believer in the importance of ecology, and especially [reducing waste at a personal level](https://perso.crans.org/besson/zero-dechet/) and [local and national political actions](https://anv-cop21.org/). I'm passionate about video games, science fiction, and fantasy! I write a lot on [my blog](https://perso.crans.org/besson/index.en.html).
